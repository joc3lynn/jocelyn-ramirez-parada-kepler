            <h2>About</h2>
               <p>I am 26 years old. I currently work at a non-profit full-time as a client assistant. I am taking Code the Dream's Intro to Programming Course, because I have always wanted to learn coding. Once I complete this course, I am planning on taking an advance course, so I can shift my career and hopefully help my community with the new skills I will learn!</p>
